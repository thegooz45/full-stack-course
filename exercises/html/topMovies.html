 <h1> brianna's top movies!</h1>
 <h2> my top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Moulin Rouge</h3>
 <p>i remember this movie fondly as a kid (do NOT ask why a child was watching this movie lol) but it's top 3</p>
<h3>Romeo & Juliet (the one with leonardo dicaprio)</h3>
<p>another movie i watched obsessively in my younger years. "kissing you" by des'ree always makes me cry</p>
<h3>kinda a toss up between "oppenheimer" and "the last showgirl"</h3>
<p>both of these movies had me leaving the theatre really thinking about life for different reasons. i definitely cried at the end of both.</p>
